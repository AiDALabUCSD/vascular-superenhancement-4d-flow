Ensure Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.1 are installed.\n2. Set up the environment using Conda or Mamba.\n3. Install the required packages.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the model with your 4D flow data to obtain enhanced vascular images.\n\n## About the Author\n\nThis repository is maintained by Akhilesh Yeluru, a graduate student. It serves as a platform to build and experiment with the creation of a vascular superenhancement model, facilitating both development and application.
