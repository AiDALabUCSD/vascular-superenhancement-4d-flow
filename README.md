## Introduction
This project aims to develop a PyTorch model that performs **vascular superenhancement**, 
enhancing the visibility of vascular structures in MRI data.

## Project Goals
The model processes **4D flow magnitude** and **velocity** data to produce a 4D flow magnitude 
volume with enhanced vasculatureâ€”simulating the effect of contrast injection.

## Data
- **Input**: 4D flow magnitude and velocity data  
- **Ground Truth**: 3D cine MRI data for vascular enhancement

## Model
The model is built using PyTorch, leveraging advanced neural network architectures 
for accurate vascular enhancement.

## Installation
1. Ensure **Python 3.10** and **CUDA 12.1** (or whichever version your GPU requires) are installed.
2. Create and activate a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n vascular_superenhancement python=3.10 \
       pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 \
       -c pytorch -c nvidia
   conda activate vascular_superenhancement
   ```
3. Install `uv` (optional) and other dependencies from your `pyproject.toml`:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   # or uv pip install -e .
   ```
