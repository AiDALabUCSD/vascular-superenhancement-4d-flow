## Introduction
This project aims to develop a PyTorch model that performs **vascular superenhancement**, 
enhancing the visibility of vascular structures in MRI data.

## Project Goals
The model processes **4D flow magnitude** and **velocity** data to produce a 4D flow magnitude 
volume with enhanced vasculatureâ€”simulating the effect of contrast injection.

## Data
- **Input**: 4D flow magnitude and velocity data  
- **Ground Truth**: 3D cine MRI data for vascular enhancement

## Model
The model is built using PyTorch, leveraging advanced neural network architectures 
for accurate vascular enhancement.

## Installation
1. Ensure **Python 3.10** and **CUDA 12.1** (or whichever version your GPU requires) are installed.
2. Create and activate a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n vascular_superenhancement python=3.10 \
       pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 \
       -c pytorch -c nvidia
   conda activate vascular_superenhancement
   ```
3. Install `uv` (optional) and other dependencies from your `pyproject.toml`:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   # or uv pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

### Data Management CLI Tools

1. **Extract Archives**
   ```bash
   python -m vascular_superenhancement.commands.extract_archives [--config CONFIG] [--overwrite]
   ```
   - Extracts all archives from the zipped directory to the unzipped directory
   - Options:
     - `--config`: Name of the config file to use (default: "default")
     - `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing extracted files if they exist

2. **Catalog DICOM Files**
   ```bash
   python -m vascular_superenhancement.commands.catalog_dicoms [--config CONFIG] [--overwrite]
   ```
   - Catalogs DICOM files for all patients in the unzipped directory
   - Options:
     - `--config`: Name of the config file to use (default: "default")
     - `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing catalog files if they exist

3. **Data Synchronization**
   ```bash
   python scripts/sync_to_nas.py
   ```
   - Synchronizes data with NAS storage system
   - Can be automated using the included cron job script:
     ```bash
     # Add to crontab (runs every 6 hours)
     0 */6 * * * /path/to/scripts/cron_sync.sh
     ```
   - Manual sync can be triggered using the `backup` alias:
     ```bash
     backup
     ```
     This runs `~/vascular-superenhancement-4d-flow/scripts/trigger_backup.sh`
     
     To set up the alias, add this line to your `~/.bashrc`:
     ```bash
     alias backup="~/vascular-superenhancement-4d-flow/scripts/trigger_backup.sh"
     ```
     Then reload your shell configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```
